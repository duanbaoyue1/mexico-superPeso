You have not filled in the utr number back after repayment or you have filled in the wrong utr number, please go to the app and submit the correct utr number<br/>2. You have submitted the correct utr number, but as you have just paid the repayment, the bank needs processing time, you can wait for 30 minutes and try to submit the utr again.<br/>3. Each time you make a repayment, please click the repayment button to get the latest repayment upi address and pay to that address. Please do not save the upi address for the next repayment as there is a possibility that the upi address has been frozen and so the order cannot be updated.<br/><br/>If the correct utr number has been submitted and it has been more than 12 hours and the order has still not been updated, please contact customer service by email with your borrowing details and a screenshot of your utr payment voucher.',
